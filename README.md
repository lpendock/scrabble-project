# UPDATES
-working off zuodong branch
-has login port and ip address entry
-server only sees port entry(since we do not need to enter ip)
-simple error checking for port(port needs to be number)
-checks to make sure name not taken(can explain logic if yall want)
-simple adjacent checking for letters
-simple winner display on close(on program only)
-hopefully nothing is broken
