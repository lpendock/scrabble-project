# scrabble
- enter in the players textbox to enter number of players(the other one does nothing)
- submit transitions to the actual board
- the 'a' button can be pressed first to enter the letter a to any tile(other letters dont do anything)
- after every letter entered on tile, dialog popup helps with scoring 
- other minor things + code is still very messy
